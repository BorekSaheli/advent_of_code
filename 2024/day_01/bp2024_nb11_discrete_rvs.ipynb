    "Consider an election where one million people will vote. 490,000 people will vote for candidate $T$ and 510,000 people will vote for candidate $B$. One day before the election, the company of 'Maurice the Dog' conducts a poll among 1000 randomly chosen voters. Compute whether the Dog will predict the winner correctly (the winner has more than 50% of the votes) using the approach explained above for generating numbers with unequal probability. Use a seed of 2."
